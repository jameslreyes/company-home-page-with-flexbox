Challenge Project: <em>Company Home Page with Flexbox</em>

Third Challenge Project from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path. Responsive fictional company home/landing page.

This project has definitely been the most pain-inducing. We were tasked with creating a homepage for a fictional company utilizing flexbox and responsive design. The thing I struggled with the most by far and large was the responsive design, my goodness. I realized after I had created the main page on my desktop that once I used Chrome DevTools to check other dimensions, my entire page completely broke and fell apart. Many many many MANY iterations later, I finally have a page that is as responsive as I am skilled enough to make it at the moment.

I think what I've learned the most is that I should essentially work on the responisivity at the same time I'm creating the actual page as a preventative measure so I don't have to go back and basically re-write the entire page for each major screen size once I <em><strong>think</strong></em> I'm finally done making the page.
